# Getting Started

## Setup

The setup of **InviteManager** is very easy.

1. Invite the bot to your server.

That's it! The bot is already tracking everybody's invites! If you want join/leave messages in your server, you have to do one more step:

1. Set the channel where join and/or leave messages will be posted:

```text
!config joinMessageChannel #channel
```

and for leave messages

```text
!config leaveMessageChannel #channel
```

You can customise the message that gets posted when a user joins and leaves. Please read the "Custom Messages" page for more info about how to do that.
